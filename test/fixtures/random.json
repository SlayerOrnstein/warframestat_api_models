It’s a hefty read below that we appreciate you taking the time to go through. Before you get started, you can look forward to a friendly in-game Inbox message with a few items from us to you. We know you’ve put a lot of time and resources into some of the things we’re changing (Melee, Vauban, Ember, etc), so please enjoy these free items by logging in before December 31st 11:59PM ET:\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.5.6","date":"2019-03-26T20:42:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1076435-buried-debts-hotfix-2456/","additions":"","changes":"Ember Prime","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.4 + 24.4.4.1","date":"2019-03-11T21:01:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1069857-buried-debts-hotfix-2444-24441/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Ember’s Fire Blast ability."},{"name":"Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0","date":"2019-03-08T02:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/","imgUrl":"http://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/f07ee60119e2c8efc746da7ecf4cb49e.png","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed incorrect FX color on impact when casting Ember’s Fireball ability."},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.0.2","date":"2018-11-09T22:23:12Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1027194-fortuna-hotfix-2402/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireball ability not applying chosen Energy colors. "},{"name":"Chimera: Update 23.10","date":"2018-10-12T13:56:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1016610-chimera-update-2310/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Transferring into Operator causing hold Abilities to continue holding until you Transfer back into your Warframe (e.g. Ember Fireball charge)."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.9.1","date":"2018-09-27T17:23:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1012649-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2391/","additions":"","changes":"Updated theme texture icons for all Warframe Skins/Helmets for Ash, Atlas, Banshee, Chroma, Ember and Equinox.","fixes":""},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.8.2","date":"2018-09-19T14:29:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1010324-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2382/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Blazing Chakram being blocked by Gara’s Mass Vitrify or Ember’s Fire Blast abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"","changes":"Tweaked the lighting of Ember’s Fireblast ability to reduce visual clutter.","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed broken reference to skeletal mesh that no longer existed on Ember’s Vermillion skin. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.17.1 - 22.17.1.1","date":"2018-04-05T18:31:09Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/942090-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22171-221711/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireblast unintentionally melting Lephantis/Hemocyte heads like a popsicle in July when cast directly on top of them. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3","date":"2018-02-21T20:18:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/924885-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22133/","additions":"","changes":"Hold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full.

Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. ","fixes":""},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0 + Hotfix 22.6.0.1","date":"2017-12-07T22:05:21Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/891096-plains-of-eidolon-update-2260-hotfix-22601/","additions":"","changes":"Removed blue undertone from Nekros Irkalla’s energy wisps.","fixes":"Fixed Nekros Irkalla showing incorrect FX."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.3.0","date":"2017-11-15T16:50:55Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/879496-plains-of-eidolon-update-2230/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed an issue with Nekros Deluxe's auxiliary and attachments not working as intended."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.5","date":"2017-11-11T02:19:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/877028-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2225/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Armor Attachments not showing up on the Nekros Irkalla skin."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.4","date":"2017-11-06T21:33:22Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/874821-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2224/","additions":"","changes":"Improved the cloth physics on Nekros’ Irkalla Binds.","fixes":"Fixed Nekros’ Irkalla Binds appearing regardless of having them equipped on Nekros and Nekros Prime. "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.3","date":"2017-11-02T23:10:08Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/872261-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2223/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nekros’ Irkalla chains clipping through his body.\nFixed Nekros’ Irkalla wrist chains floating away.  "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.1","date":"2017-11-01T23:18:24Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/871440-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2221/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nekros Prime arm dangle details appearing when equipped on the Nekros Irkalla Skin. As is standard and precedent for all in-house Deluxe Skins, the override of Prime Details is the intent. "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.2.0","date":"2017-11-01T20:54:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/871334-plains-of-eidolon-update-2220/","additions":"Defy death itself, and crush the living with new Deluxe skins for Nekros and Ember!

With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.6.0 + 20.6.0.1","date":"2017-05-24T20:42:16Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/800141-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2060-20601/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed some animation pops when casting Oberon’s Reckoning."},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.5.0","date":"2017-05-17T19:16:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/797978-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2050/","additions":"","changes":"Improved Oberon’s Hallowed Ground ability to go up slopers.","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Hotfix 20.4.4","date":"2017-05-08T21:42:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/795023-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-hotfix-2044/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Oberon’s Hallowed Ground FX not disappearing after a Host migration.

For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease.

Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. ","fixes":""},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.8.3","date":"2018-01-11T14:32:42Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/906556-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2283/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Shred decreasing Vauban's armour instead of the enemies'."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.4","date":"2017-11-06T21:33:22Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/874821-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2224/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Vauban’s Minelayer ability."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.0.3","date":"2017-10-16T21:47:16Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/859709-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2203/","additions":"","changes":"Only 2 of Vauban’s Minelayer can be active at a time in Conclave.","fixes":""},{"name":"Warframe Update 22: Plains of Eidolon","date":"2017-10-12T22:00:20Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/854253-warframe-update-22-plains-of-eidolon/","additions":"","changes":"Duration removed from Vauban's Tesla deployables and a max of 2 deployed at once added in Conclave.","fixes":"Fixed the Melee combo counter overlapping Nidus, Vauban, and Ivara’s ability UI indicators. "},{"name":"Update 21: Chains of Harrow","date":"2017-06-29T03:00:20Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/809842-update-21-chains-of-harrow/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Vauban’s Vortex sometimes spontaneously killing enemies. \nFixed Nidina Shoulder Plates clipping on Vauban Prime."},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Hotfix 20.2.3","date":"2017-04-19T22:08:42Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/788574-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-hotfix-2023/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Vauban's Vortex not affecting ragdolled enemies."},{"name":"Octavia's Anthem: Update 20","date":"2017-03-24T19:46:02Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/776642-octavias-anthem-update-20/","additions":"","changes":"Fixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker during Vauban’s Vortex, and Nezha’s Blazing Chakram and Warding Halo.","fixes":""},{"name":"The Pacifism Defect: Hotfix 19.12.2","date":"2017-03-06T22:01:18Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/770075-the-pacifism-defect-hotfix-19122/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Vauban’s Bastille and Vortex lingering in tiles after players have left said tile.This resulted in enemies continually being damaged or immobile even after the ability ended."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.11.2","date":"2017-02-17T20:40:41Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/763931-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-19112/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a seam/texture issue on the Vauban Suppressor Skin. "},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.5.4","date":"2017-01-03T18:58:02Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/744765-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1954/","additions":"","changes":"Nidus’ Larva no longer latches enemies trapped in Vauban’s Bastille.","fixes":""},{"name":"The War Within: Hotfix 19.3.2 + 19.3.2.1","date":"2016-12-13T19:17:37Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/734004-the-war-within-hotfix-1932-19321/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a couple memory leaks and offset damage triggers with Vauban’s Tesla Link Augment Mod."},{"name":"The War Within: Hotfix 19.3.1","date":"2016-12-07T23:58:24Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/731292-the-war-within-hotfix-1931/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed memory/object leak with Vauban's Vortex and Simulor.\nFixed a rare script crash in Vauban's Tesla if the entity it attached to was killed within a quarter-second of attachment."},{"name":"Update 19: The War Within","date":"2016-11-12T04:02:28Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/715768-update-19-the-war-within/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Vauban’s Bastille FX remaining indefinitely upon Host migration.\nFixed Vauban's passive, Reinforce, not applying after being revived and until a player enters or exits the radius. "},{"name":"The Index Preview: Hotfix #2","date":"2016-10-21T15:49:40Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/709888-the-index-preview-hotfix-2/","additions":"","changes":"Excluded Reactant and Index Point pickups from Simulor, Inaros' Sandstorm, Zephyr Tornado, and Vauban's Vortex.

With new energy requirements, the cast cost of Primal Fury was lowered but cast drain was increased to be turned off and on as desired.\nThe range of Wukong’s Iron Staff is always long, comparable to top range Zaws, and no longer needs to build combo to scale range.","fixes":""},{"name":"The Jovian Concord: Update 25.1.0","date":"2019-06-05T18:36:15Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1100452-the-jovian-concord-update-2510/","imgUrl":"http://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/7e35d85fa4c0cdbad0d77de0f9c3435d.jpg","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Zanuka being unable to capture Hildryn, Wisp, Revenant, Chroma, Frost, Excalibur, Inaros, Nova, Vauban, Volt, Wukong, Ash, Hydroid, Mag, Trinity, Titania and Valkyr."},{"name":"The Jovian Concord: Update 25","date":"2019-05-22T21:31:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1094942-the-jovian-concord-update-25/","additions":"Added Ability videos in the Ability UI for Inaros, Ivara, Nidus, Titania, and Wukong!","changes":"","fixes":""},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.2.1","date":"2018-12-18T15:50:10Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1044968-fortuna-hotfix-2421/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Wukong’s Iron Jab ability."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.7.1","date":"2018-09-06T20:46:57Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1006342-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2371/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Wukong’s Enveloping Cloud Augment Duration scaling off of Modded Power Range instead of Duration."},{"name":"The Sacrifice: Hotfix 23.0.8","date":"2018-07-09T20:05:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/980491-the-sacrifice-hotfix-2308/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed using a Warframe with an Exalted Melee weapon (Excalibur, Wukong or Valkyr), certain actions will lead to a weird \"in-between\" state, where your Exalted Melee Stance incorporates moves from your currently equipped melee weapon. "},{"name":"The Sacrifice: Update 23","date":"2018-06-15T00:51:48Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/967249-the-sacrifice-update-23/","additions":"","changes":"Wukong’s Iron Staff","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed being unable to cast Wukong's Primal Fury after giving your Secondary weapon to a Rescue Target in a 'Secondary Only' Sortie."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.19.0","date":"2018-05-02T18:30:06Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/952702-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22190/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Thrown weapons equipped with Power Throw scaling with the range from Wukong’s Iron Vault Augment.
